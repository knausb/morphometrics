title: "Plant morphometrics"
---

Morphometrics is the quantitative study of morphology.
The purpose of this document is to provide examples of morphometric analyses of plant based data sets using R.
The organization of these analyses is intended to be based on questions a researcher may have.
This is an attempt to combine the research questions an individual or team may have with existing statistical analyses that attempt to address these questions.


Through time I hope to populate these pages with a fairly thorough set of examples.
